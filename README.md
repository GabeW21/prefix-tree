# prefix-tree
Building the data structure of a prefix tree (trie).

Note: Basic structure was referenced from geeksforgeeks.org. Did not directly copy but used as a reference when creating the insert and delete functions, and the class. Intended to independently develop the rest of the functions either utilizing those basics or heavily modifying them.
